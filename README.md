# sentiment-analysis
This is an attempt at a really basic Python Sentiment Analysis using TextBlob API

This is not the most accurate Machine Learning model, but the main purpose is to start learning about AI and ML in general.

# Dataset

The dataset used can be found here: https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
However, for the source code I have taken just a part of the txt files on the dataset. I have divided into *training positive, training negative, test positive* and *test negative*

# Bibliography

I have tried to mimic the tutorial on the TextBlob site: https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/classifiers.html#classifiers

I have also studied and used the Regex code on this article: https://towardsdatascience.com/sentiment-analysis-with-python-part-1-5ce197074184
